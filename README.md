## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## Acknowledgments

Michael helped me to move from a straight HTML/CSS/JS developer into a React frontend developer. Normally this would not be a needed acknowledgement, however, he took all the things I already knew how to do and moved them into an order that makes sense in order to create good workflows. He does this for many people in many situations, so I thought this little acknowledgment might make his day! He is excellent at what he does. Everyone should want him on their team.
